								<h2>Project Outline</h2>
								<p>This concept is based around the discovery of relatively unknown physical internet infrastructure, being submarine fibre-optic cables that connect various countries and continents to each other. The aim of this project is to make these internet infrastructure components more accessible and “real” to internet users, in turn creating the opportunity to educate and inform them about this seemingly abstract concept. Another aim for this project is to bring aspects of the internet that are widely perceived as abstract and largely lacking in physical tangible form into the material world. </p>

								<p>This concept will be presented to users using two components. The first is a mobile phone application that utilises GPS function in the context of an interactive map that directs the user towards points where submarine fibre-optic cables used for internet purposes make landfall. The second component is a series of NFC (near-field-communication) tags that are positioned at these locations. When scanned by the user’s smartphone, these tags reveal information regarding the cable, for example its origin, how long it travels, and when it was first installed. </p>

								<p>Many individuals perceive the internet as a system to be intangible, abstract, and in a sense, mysterious in nature. This is especially relevant considering the current shift we can see as internet access makes a significant shift towards wireless networks such as Wi-Fi, and more recently, 5G.</p>

								<p>Inspiration for this project has been collected from a wide variety of sources. Visual inspiration has been drawn from the physical composition of a fibre-optic cable itself, and pre-existing maps that show the global fibre-optic cable network. Inspiration for the concept behind the project has also been gathered from these aforementioned pre-existing maps, as well as existing GPS programs and games such as Pokemon GO, and geocaching platforms.</p>

								<h2>Logo</h2>
								<p>The SubOptic logo is comprised of elements that are designed to mimic the visual appearance of fibre-optic cable components.</p>

									<p>The “O” in the logo is representative of a cross-section of a fibre-optic cable itself, with the various layers being the core, cladding, buffer, and jacket. Each of these different layers is represented by a different colour in the shape.</p>

									<p>The elongated first and last letters of the text are designed to mimic the lines that represent that location of the fibre-optic cables on submarine cable maps that show the location of underwater fibre-optic cables globally. </p>

								<h2>Project components</h2>
								<p>AThere are two additional project components aside from the branding elements such as logo design and typography specifications. These are the NFC (near-field-communication) tag, and the mobile device app icon. The app functions as the platform on which the user can view the map and explore the various locations of where the submarine fibre-optic cables make landfall. The NFC tags are found at these locations. SubOptic app users discover the position of these tags through use of the map inside the app. When the tags are scanned, information regarding the cable is revealed to the user. This information can include data such as the origin and length of the cable, as well as the date that it was installed. </p>

								<h2>Project Inspiration</h2>

							<ul class="features">
								<li class="">
									<h3>I - Pokemon GO</h3>
									<p>Pokemon GO is a free smartphone app available both on iOS and Android devices. The app successfully combines mobile gaming with the real world. The Pokemon GO game uses a combination of location tracking, GPS, online mapping and virtual reality technology to create an augmented reality platform (Niantic, Inc., 2020). This gaming system provides users with a platform where they are able to catch and interact with Pokemon game characters in real locations.
									</p>
									<p>The Pokemon GO game has influenced this project as it revolves around the use of a real-time GPS and map interaction. This is the basis of the project as users of SubOptic will access the interactive map as a part of the app, and they will use this platform to explore the real world around them and discover fibre-optic infrastructure as they would Pokemon game characters.</p>

								</li>
								<li class="">
									<h3>II - Geocaching</h3>
									<p>Geocaching is a real-world, outdoor adventure that involves participants downloading the Geocaching app or using a GPS device to navigate to and discover cleverly hidden containers that are referred to as geocaches (Groundspeak, Inc., 2020). Currently, there are over 3 million geocaches located in over 190 countries, however when geocaching first started in early 2000, only 75 geocaches had been hidden (Groundspeak, Inc., 2020). Geocaches come in a variety of sizes, shapes and difficulties, and they are also hidden in both rural and urban settings.</p>
									<p>The Geocaching program has inspired this project as it is a pre-existing platform on which users can interact with the map and use it to locate assets in the real world. Furthermore, geocaching offers something for a wide range of users, from families with children to retirees.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="">
									<h3>III - Submarine Cable Map</h3>
									<p>There are currently over 420 submarine fibre-optic internet cables in service globally, stretching over 1.1 million kilometres around the world (Routley, 2017). These cables connect countries and contients, and although there is a higher concentration of these cables around economic hot spots, such as New York CIty and SIngapore, the cables connect to almost everywhere in the world. </p>
									<p>The Submarine Cable Map, powered by TeleGeogrpahy, has inspired visual aspects of this project. The way in which the map represents cable directions and cable beginnings and endings is emulated in the logo design through the choice of font, as well as the modification and elongation of both the first and last letter. This is also emulated thorugh the addiiton of the rounded ends of these elongated letters.</p>
